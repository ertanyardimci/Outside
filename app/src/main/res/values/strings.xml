    <string name="rainy_day_aphorism">When that I was and a little tiny boy,
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
A foolish thing was but a toy,
For the rain it raineth every day …

    -William Shakespeare</string>
    <string name="snow_day_aphorism">I leant upon a coppice gate,
When Frost was spectre-gray,
And Winter’s dregs made desolate
The weakening eye of day.
The tangled bine-stems scored the sky
Like strings of broken lyres,
And all mankind that haunted nigh
Had sought their household fires…

    -Thomas Hardy</string>
    <string name="randomly">If it\'s time to buy iron now,
A ship to the unknown departs from this port.
The road takes silently as if it had no passengers;
Neither a handkerchief nor an arm does not shake on that take off.
Those who stay at the quay are sad from this trip,
He stares at the black horizon for days, his eyes moist.
Desperate hearts! This is neither the last ship that goes!
What the last mourning of a life of anger</string>
